**Here, I have compiled my salient individual university projects.**

# What about other languages?

## HTML/CSS/JavaScript
You can find my experience with these languages in the other public projects on
my profile:

## Python
I have a semester of experience with Python, as my Computational Physics course
also served as a comprehensive introductory Python course.

### So, why is it absent?
Unfortunately, I took the course while it was still in the testing phase, so not
all aspects were fully developed. As a result, the coursework was completed on
Jupyter Notebook hosted on a private server, and I was unable to download my
work because it contained proprietary course material.

## Note on SQL
On top of taking the course, I served as a Teaching Assistant for the
Database Systems (CS 260) course under Dr. Vanamala for a semester, where I
guided students, graded assignments and tests, and occasionally gave lectures and
provided supplementary instruction.
