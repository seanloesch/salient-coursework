**Here, I have compiled my salient individual university projects.**

# What about other languages?

## HTML/CSS/JavaScript
You can find my experience with these languages in the other public projects on
my profile:

- [secure-arcade](https://github.com/seanloesch/secure-arcade)

## Python
I have a semester of experience with Python, as my Computational Physics
course also served as a comprehensive introductory Python course.

I later conducted my first academic research using Python and have elementary
experience in:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP), more specifically, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
- Using machine learning algorithms for classification and regression, such as Support
Vector Machines (SVM), Naive-Bayes (and its three variants), Neural Networks, Decision
Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and gradient boosting
- Ethical web scraping using BeautifulSoup and inspecting `robots.txt` files for
websites with rules regarding web crawlers

### So, why is it absent?
I unfortunately took the course while it was still in a preliminary testing phase, so
not all aspects were fully developed. As a result, the coursework was completed on
Jupyter Notebook hosted on a private server, and I was unable to download my work
because it contained proprietary course material.

I cannot share the code used to conduct my research for reasons I am not allowed to
divulge.

## Note on SQL
On top of taking the Database Systems (CS 260) course (as it was required), I served
as a Teaching Assistant for the course for a semester, where I guided students,
graded assignments and tests, and occasionally gave lectures and provided supplementary
instruction.
