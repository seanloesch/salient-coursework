### About This Project
This program was originally written in MARS, a lightweight IDE for programming
in MIPS assembly. Instructions for setup can be found here:
https://www.d.umn.edu/~gshute/mips/Mars/Mars.html. The official GitHub page can
be found here: https://github.com/dpetersanderson/MARS/.

### Attachments
In the `attachments` directory, you will find a word document containing the
algorithm I used to conceptualize and construct the program.

# OVERVIEW
This program reverses a user-input string in place and prints the result. It
supports strings up to 25 characters in length.

## How to Use
You will be prompted to enter a string up to 25 characters in length upon
running the program. Once you do so, the program will print the reversed version
of your string to the console.

## Notes
- There is no handling for strings longer than 25 characters, which may result
in undefined behavior.
