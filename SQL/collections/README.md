### About This Project
These programs were originally written in MySQL Workbench.

# OVERVIEW
This is a collection of salvaged SQL queries I wrote during my time in the Database
Systems (CS 260) course at UWEC, as well as during my subsequent role as a
Teaching Assistant for the course.

Unfortunately, I have since lost the SQL files used to create and populate the
tables I performed the queries on. This is what remains.
