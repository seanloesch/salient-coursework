### About This Project

# OVERVIEW
This is a program that prompts the user to populate a binary matrix (a matrix
containing only 0s and 1s) of the user's desired size (minimum size 1x1, maximum
size 64x64), eliminates the duplicate rows, and prints the resultant matrix to
the console.

The program was designed to illustrate my understanding of Java streams and
RegEx.

## How to Use
To use the program, simply run it, and you will be prompted to enter the number
of rows and columns for the matrix. Next, you will input binary values for each
index, moving row by row. After filling the matrix, the program will display the
populated matrix in the console. Lastly, it will display the version of the same
matrix without duplicate rows.

## Output
The output for this program includes, in this order:

1. The prompts for the user to populate the matrix.
2. The filled matrix after population is complete.
3. The same matrix, minus any duplicate rows.
