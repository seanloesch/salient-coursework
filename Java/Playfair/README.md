# OVERVIEW
This program decrypts text that has been encrypted using the Playfair cipher,
the first practical digraph substitution cipher famously used in both world
wars, given the corresponding key. For information on the playfair cipher, go to
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/playfair-cipher-with-examples/.

## How to Use
Simply run main and follow the prompts:

1. Enter a key containing only non-repeating alphabetical characters you
would like to use.

2. Enter ciphertext containing only alphabetical characters you would like to
decrypt on one line in the console.

3. Receive decrypted plaintext.

## Output
The only outputs are the user prompts and the resultant plaintext printed to
the console.

## Example
Try using the key "monarchy" with the encrypted text "gatlmzclrqtx". The
result should be "instrumentsz". The example along with an explanation can be
found here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/playfair-cipher-with-examples/.
